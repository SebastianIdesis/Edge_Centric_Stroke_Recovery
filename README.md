# Edge_Centric_Stroke_Recovery

Calculate Edge-centric properties in a stroke dataset as in Idesis et al (2022).

These scripts use MATLAB. They were tested using MATLAB 2020a. They require no additional software packages.

Installation and usage:
Download and unzip the directory, open MATLAB, and then navigate to wherever you downloaded the files. You can run the script from within that directory.

Comment: For the publication, normalized entropy was selected by using a representative cluster. In the uploaded scripts this step was omitted reduce the execution time.
